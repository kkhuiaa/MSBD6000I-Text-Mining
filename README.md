In this report, the importance of text analysis for stock price prediction is investigated, by introducing the prediction of Tencent companyâ€™s stock price changes (UP, DOWN). Our results indicate that by leveraging the text information with the text mining techniques, such as BERT pretrained model and sentiment analysis, machine learning model can boosts the prediction accuracy by 5% (relative), comparing with only applying traditional technical indicators.
